This hypothesis suggests a new interpretation for the observed bending2 and apparent precession3 of radio jets emerging from these objects and may indeed be verified through detection of the direct consequences of orbital motion.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of cutting-edge circumbinary disk (CBD) evolution models on massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations and the gravitational wave background (GWB). We show that CBD-driven evolution leaves a tell-tale signature in MBHB populations, by driving binaries towards an equilibrium eccentricity that depends on binary mass ratio. We find high orbital eccentricities (\$e\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$) as MBHBs enter multi-messenger observable frequency bands. The CBD-induced eccentricity distribution of MBHB populations in observable bands is independent of the initial eccentricity distribution at binary formation, erasing any memory of eccentricities induced in the large-scale dynamics of merging galaxies. Our results suggest that eccentric MBHBs are the rule rather than the exception in upcoming transient surveys, provided that CBDs regularly form in MBHB systems. We show that the GWB amplitude is sensitive to CBD-driven preferential accretion onto the secondary, resulting in an increase in GWB amplitude \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ by over 100{\textbackslash}\% with just 10{\textbackslash}\% Eddington accretion. As we self consistently allow for binary hardening and softening, we show that CBD-driven orbital expansion does not diminish the GWB amplitude, and instead increases the amplitude by a small amount. We further present detection rates and population statistics of MBHBs with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}6 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ in LISA, showing that most binaries have equal mass ratios and can retain residual eccentricities up to \$e\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ due to CBD-driven evolution.},

For the first time, we investigate the preferential accretion rate as a function of both eccentricity eb and mass ratio qb in a densely sampled parameter space, finding that when compared with circular binaries, (i) mass ratios grow more efficiently in binaries on moderately eccentric orbits (0.0 ≲ eb ≲ 0.4), and (ii) high eccentricities (eb ≳ 0.6) suppress mass ratio growth. We suggest that this non-monotonic preferential accretion behaviour may produce an observable shift in the mass ratio distributions of stellar binaries and massive black hole binaries. We further find that the response of a CBD can be divided into three regimes, depending on eccentricity and mass ratio: (i) CBDs around circular binaries always precess freely, whereas CBDs around eccentric binaries either (ii) undergo forced precession or (iii) remain locked at an angle with respect to the binary periapsis. Forced precession in eccentric binaries is associated with strong modulation of individual accretion rates on the precession time-scale, a potentially observable signature in accreting binaries with short orbital periods. We provide CBD locking angles and precession rates as a function of eb and qb for our simulation suite.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total BH mass density, ρSMBH=4×105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

	abstract = {Observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the mass of the central dark object M and the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy, of the form log(M/M\_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma\_0); however, published estimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). Merritt \& Ferrarese have argued that low slopes ({\textless}4) arise because of neglect of random measurement errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations account for at most a small part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese \& Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r\_e/8 (r\_e is the effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination of the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, for sigma\_0=200 km/s. The M-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log M that is no larger than 0.3 dex. In an Appendix, we present a simple model for the velocity-dispersion profile of the Galactic bulge.},

	abstract = {New kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years have substantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses (Mbh) at the centers of nearby galaxies. Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between Mbh and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (Mbulge), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power law relations for the full galaxy sample are log(Mbh) = 8.32 + 5.64*log(sigma/200 kms), log(Mbh) = 9.23 + 1.11*log(L/10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Lsun), and log(Mbh) = 8.46 + 1.05*log(Mbulge/10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msun). A log-quadratic fit to the Mbh-sigma relation with an additional term of beta\_2*[log(sigma/200 kms)]{\textasciicircum}2 gives beta\_2 = 1.68 +/- 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in Mbh. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the Mbh-sigma relation but significantly different intercepts -- Mbh in early-type galaxies are about 2 times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to Mbh(sigma) give Mbh that is about 2 times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our Mbh-L and Mbh-Mbulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in Mbh, our dataset shows weak evidence for increased scatter at Mbulge {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msun or L\_V {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3\} Lsun, while the scatter stays constant for 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textless} Mbulge {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12.3\} Msun and 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3\} {\textless} L\_V {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\} Lsun. A Bayesian analysis indicates a larger sample of Mbh measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter (epsilon\_0) in both relations. We find log(M\_BH / M\_sun) = alpha + beta * log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon\_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/- 0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon\_0) = (8.23 +/- 0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M-sigma relation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-sigma relation. We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M\_BH / M\_sun) = alpha + beta * log(L\_V / 10{\textasciicircum}11 L\_sun,V) of (alpha, beta, epsilon\_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18, 0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter.

	abstract = {Deep within galaxies like the Milky Way, astronomers have found a fascinating legacy of Einstein's general theory of relativity: supermassive black holes. Connected to the evolution of the galaxies that contain these black holes, galactic nuclei are the sites of uniquely energetic events, including quasars, stellar tidal disruptions, and the generation of gravitational waves. This textbook is the first comprehensive introduction to dynamical processes occurring in the vicinity of supermassive black holes in their galactic environment. Filling a critical gap, it is an authoritative resource for astrophysics and physics graduate students, and researchers focusing on galactic nuclei, the astrophysics of massive black holes, galactic dynamics, and gravitational wave detection. It is an ideal text for an advanced graduate-level course on galactic nuclei and as supplementary reading in graduate-level courses on high-energy astrophysics and galactic dynamics. David Merritt summarizes the theoretical work of the last three decades on the evolution of galactic nuclei, the formation of massive black holes, and the interaction between black holes and stars. He explores in depth such important topics as observations of galactic nuclei, dynamical models, weighing black holes, motion near supermassive black holes, evolution of nuclei due to gravitational encounters, loss cone theory, and binary supermassive black holes. Self-contained and up-to-date, the textbook includes a summary of the current literature and previously unpublished work by the author. For researchers working on active galactic nuclei, galaxy evolution, and the generation of gravitational waves, this book will be an essential resource.},

	abstract = {Coalescence of binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) would constitute the strongest sources of gravitational waves to be observed by LISA. While the formation of binary SBHs during galaxy mergers is almost inevitable, coalescence requires that the separation between binary components first drop by a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to interaction of the binary with stars and gas in a galactic nucleus. This article reviews the observational evidence for binary SBHs and discusses how they would evolve. No completely convincing case of a bound, binary SBH has yet been found, although a handful of systems (e.g. interacting galaxies; remnants of galaxy mergers) are now believed to contain two SBHs at projected separations of {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1kpc. N-body studies of binary evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached large enough particle numbers to reproduce the slow, "diffusive" refilling of the binary's loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in real galactic nuclei. While some of the results of these simulations - e.g. the binary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution - are strongly N-dependent, others - e.g. the "damage" inflicted by the binary on the nucleus - are not. Luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted cores with masses of {\textasciitilde} 1-2 times the mass of their nuclear SBHs, consistent with the predictions of the binary model. Studies of the interaction of massive binaries with gas are still in their infancy, although much progress is expected in the near future. Binary coalescence has a large influence on the spins of SBHs, even for mass ratios as extreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been observed.},

	abstract = {We use a hybrid N-body program to study the evolution of massive black hole binaries in the centers of galaxies, mainly to understand the factors affecting the binary eccentricity, the response of the galaxy to the binary merger, and the effect of loss-cone depletion on the merger time. The scattering experiments from paper I (Quinlan, 1996)[NewA, 1, 35] showed that the merger time is not sensitive to the eccentricity growth unless a binary forms with at least a moderate eccentricity. We find here that the eccentricity can become large under some conditions if a binary forms in a galaxy with a flat core or with a radial bias in its velocity distribution, especially if the dynamical friction is enhanced by resonances as suggested by Rauch \& Tremaine (1996)[NewA, 1, 149]. But the necessary conditions seem unlikely, and our prediction from paper I remains unchanged: in most cases the eccentricity will start and remain small. The ejection of stars caused by the hardening of a binary may explain why large elliptical galaxies have weaker density cusps than smaller galaxies. If so, the central velocity distributions in those galaxies should have strong tangential anisotropies. The wandering of a binary from the center of a galaxy counteracts the effects of loss-cone depletion and helps the binary merge.},

	abstract = {We study the observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the relation between BH mass and velocity dispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be ρ•(z= 0) ≃ (2.5 ± 0.4) × 105h0.652M⊙ Mpc−3. We also use the quasi-stellar object (QSO) luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate the BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH mass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright QSO phases if QSOs have a mass-to-energy conversion efficiency ε≃ 0.1. By studying the continuity equation for the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find relations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function. If the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the predicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s−1) have a high efficiency (e.g. ε∼ 0.2, which is possible for thin-disc accretion on to a Kerr BH) and the growth of high-mass BHs (≳108M⊙) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright QSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If luminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the growth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases, less luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency, \&lt;0.1; alternatively, they may accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be obscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s−1) is (3–13) × 107 yr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in which total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation; in the extreme case in which total BH entropy is conserved, the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs accreting with an efficiency ≳0.1.},

Ambient stars drawn from a Maxwellian distribution unbound to the binary are expelled by the gravitational slingshot. Accurate measurements of thermally averaged hardening, mass ejection, and eccentricity growth rates (H, J, and K) for MBHBs in a fixed stellar background are obtained by numerical orbit integration from initial conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques. Three-body interactions create a subpopulation of HVSs on nearly radial, corotating orbits, with a spatial distribution that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with decreasing binary separation. The degree of anisotropy is smaller for unequal mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities. Eccentric MBHBs produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity stars and break planar symmetry, ejecting HVSs along a broad jet perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet two-sidedness decreases with increasing binary mass ratio, while the jet opening-angle increases with decreasing kick velocity and orbital separation. The detection of a numerous population of HVSs in the halo of the Milky Way by the next generation of large astrometric surveys like GAIA may provide a unique signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at the Galactic center.},

A binary ejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the host galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for collisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially underestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for nonequilibrium loss cone dynamics and calculate timescales for the decay of massive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly higher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation, decay of binaries can persist as a result of repeated ejection of stars returning to the nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to a gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on time. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body experiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times as a result of spurious relaxation.},

Gas and star particles are copresent in the disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4 × 106 M⊙ is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in ∼10 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs, weighing ≈2 per cent of the black hole mass, and of size ∼0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an estimated time-scale of ≲10 Myr, comparable to the inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution will have typical separations of ≲10 pc.},

	abstract = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e≳ 0.35. Accretion on to the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 105≲M≲ 108 M⊙ we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a∼ 0.01–0.1 pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M≲ 107 M⊙. This implies that gas discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.},

We show that these discs are susceptible to tearing for almost all inclinations. We also show that tearing of the disc can result in a significant acceleration of the disc evolution and subsequent accretion on to the binary – by factors up to 104 times that of a coplanar prograde disc with otherwise identical parameters. This provides a promising mechanism for driving mergers of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries on time-scales much shorter than a Hubble time. Disc tearing also suggests new observational signatures of accreting SMBH binaries and other systems such as protostellar binaries.},

	abstract = {The formation of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is an unavoidable outcome of galaxy evolution via successive mergers. However, the mechanism that drives their orbital evolution from parsec separations down to the gravitational wave dominated regime is poorly understood, and their final fate is still unclear. If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent environments, as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with gas clumps (such as molecular clouds) may efficiently drive their orbital evolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis by studying the dynamical evolution of an equal mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling molecular clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a total of 13 systems to explore different possible impact parameters and relative inclinations of the cloud–binary encounter. We focus our study on the prompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical evolution of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by the exchange of angular momentum through gas capture by the individual black holes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct a simple model for evolving an MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn from reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their angular momenta distributions. We show that the binary efficiently evolves down to the gravitational wave emission regime within a few hundred million years, overcoming the ‘final parsec’ problem regardless of the stellar distribution.},

For binaries accreting at their combined Eddington limit, a steady state eccentricity can be achieved within a few Megayears.

	abstract = {We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamics simulations of circumbinary disk (CBD) accretion using AREPO. We resolve the accretion flow from a large-scale CBD down to the streamers and disks around individual binary components. Extending our recent studies, we consider circular binaries with various mass ratios (0.1 ≤ qb ≤ 1) and study accretion from “infinite,” steady-supply disks and from finite-sized, viscously spreading tori. For “infinite” disks, a global steady state can be reached, and the accretion variability has a dominant frequency ∼0.2Ωb for qb {\textgreater} 0.5 and Ωb for qb {\textless} 0.5 (Ωb is the binary angular frequency). We find that the accretion “eigenvalue” l0—the net angular momentum transfer from the disk to the binary per unit accreted mass—is always positive and falls in the range (0.65– (with ab the binary separation), depending weakly on the mass ratio and viscosity. This leads to binary expansion when qb ≳ 0.3. Accretion from a finite torus can be separated into two phases: an initial transient phase, corresponding to the filling of the binary cavity, followed by a viscous pseudostationary phase, during which the torus viscously spreads and accretes onto the binary. In the viscous phase, the net torque on the binary per unit accreted mass is close to l0, the value derived for “infinite” disks. We conclude that binaries of similar mass accreting from CBDs gain angular momentum and expand over long timescales. This result significantly impacts the coalescence of supermassive binary black holes and newly formed binary stars. We offer a word of caution against conclusions drawn from simulations of transient accretion onto empty circumbinary cavities.},

To do so, we perform 3D, hydrodynamic, locally isothermal simulations of circumbinary disks on a Cartesian grid. We focus on binaries of equal mass ratios on fixed circular orbits. To investigate the orbital evolution of the binary, we examine the various torques exerted on the system. For the case where the disk plane and binary orbital plane are aligned, we find that the total torque is positive so that the semimajor axis of the binary increases. For the misaligned case, we run simulations with the binary orbital plane and disk midplane misaligned by 45° and find the same results—the binary grows. The timescale for the circumbinary disk to realign to the plane of the binary is consistent with the global viscous timescale of the disk.},

	abstract = {We compute the effect of an orbiting gas disc in promoting the coalescence of a central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a finite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas necessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e. that the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre-existing accretion disc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's gravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc in a simple energy feedback framework.The disc spectrum differs in detail from that found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole heat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These rims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but can on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from the disc. This may lead to detectable high-photon-energy variability on the relatively long orbital time-scale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a prospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary.We also find that the disc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable time-scale only if its mass is at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the initial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. a0≲ 0.05 pc. Star formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc. In the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc mass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio is ≲0.001. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the ‘last parsec’ problem for a significant class of mergers.},

Following galaxy merger trees from the Millennium simulation, we model BH mergers with two extreme binary decay scenarios for the `hard binary' stage: a full or an empty loss cone. These two models should bracket the true evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of dynamical friction and that of multi-body BH interactions on BH mergers. Using the computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the dynamical evolution of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers with various mass ratios (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textless} q\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textless} 1\$). Our main result demonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the empty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions, avoiding the `final parsec' problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial orbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment, albeit more approximate, suggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant, leading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime \${\textbackslash}lesssim1 \{{\textbackslash}rm {\textasciitilde}Gyr\}\$). Despite the lower merger rates in the empty loss cone case, due to their higher mass ratios and lower redshifts, the GWB in the full/empty loss cone models are comparable (\$0.70{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and \$0.53{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a frequency of \$1{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively).

When the ratio of the semi-major axes of the asteroid and Jupiter takes a very small value, the solutions are expressed by elliptic functions. When the z component of the angular momentum (that is, Delaunay's H) of the asteroid is smaller than a certain limiting value, there are both a stationary solution and solutions corresponding to libration cases. The limiting value of H increases as the ratio of the semimajor axes increases, i.e., the corresponding limiting inclination drops from 39.2° to 1.8° as the ratio of the axes increases from 0.0 to 0.95.},

In this approximation, the energy of each orbit is separately conserved, and therefore the two semimajor axes are constants. On timescales much larger than the orbital periods, the orbits exchange angular momentum, which leads to eccentricity and orientation (i.e., inclination) oscillations. The orbits' eccentricity can reach extreme values, leading to a nearly radial motion, which can further evolve into short orbit periods and merging binaries. Furthermore, the orbits' mutual inclinations may change dramatically from pure prograde to pure retrograde, leading to misalignment and a wide range of inclinations. This dynamical behavior is coined the “eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism.” The behavior of such a system is exciting, rich, and chaotic in nature. Furthermore, these dynamics are accessible from a large part of the triple-body parameter space and can be applied to a diverse range of astrophysical settings and used to gain insights into many puzzles.},

Those SMBHs are also expected to grow hierarchically, experiencing a series of mergers with other SMBHs brought in by merging satellites. Because of the net linear momentum taken away from the asymmetric gravitational wave emission, the remnant SMBH experiences a kick in the opposite direction. Kicks may be as large as {\textasciitilde}5000 Km/s ("superkicks"), pushing the SMBHs out in the cluster outskirts for a time comparable to galaxy-evolution timescales.

Following the kick, the motion of the SMBH exhibits three distinct phases. (1) The SMBH oscillates with decreasing amplitude, losing energy via dynamical friction at each core passage. Chandrasekhar's theory accurately reproduces the motion of the SMBH if 2lesssim ln Λ lesssim 3 and if the changing core density is taken into account. (2) When the amplitude of the motion has fallen to roughly the core radius, the SMBH and core begin to exhibit oscillations about their common center of mass. These oscillations decay with a time constant that is at least 10 times longer than predicted by Chandrasekhar's formula. (3) Eventually, the SMBH reaches thermal equilibrium with the stars. The time for the SMBH's oscillations to damp to the Brownian level is as long as {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr in the brightest galaxies. The longevity of the oscillations makes this mechanism competitive with others proposed to explain double or offset nuclei. Ejection of SMBHs also results in a lowered density of stars near the galaxy center; mass deficits as large as five times the SMBH mass can be produced. We compare the N-body density profiles with luminosity profiles of early-type galaxies in Virgo and show that even the largest observed cores can be reproduced by the kicks. Implications for displaced AGNs and helical radio structures are discussed.},

	abstract = {We consider the consequences of gravitational wave recoil for unified models of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Spatial oscillations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) around the cores of galaxies following gravitational wave (GW) recoil imply that the SMBHs spend a significant fraction of time off-nucleus, at scales beyond that of the molecular obscuring torus. Assuming reasonable distributions of recoil velocities, we compute the off-core timescale of (intrinsically type-2) quasars. We find that roughly one-half of major mergers result in a SMBH being displaced beyond the torus for a time of 30 Myr or more, comparable to quasar activity timescales. Since major mergers are most strongly affected by GW recoil, our results imply a deficiency of type 2 quasars in comparison to Seyfert 2 galaxies. Other consequences of the recoil oscillations for the observable properties of AGNs are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Gravitational-wave recoil of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may influence the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. We examine this possibility using smoothed particle hydrodynamic/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers, including SMBH accretion, in which the merged BH receives a recoil kick. This enables us to follow the trajectories and accretion of recoiling BHs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. In contrast to recent studies on similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite of over 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoil velocities (vk). With this, we can identify systematic trends in the behaviour of recoiling BHs. Our main results are as follows. (1) BHs kicked at nearly the central escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a Hubble time, but in gas-rich mergers, BHs kicked with up to ∼0.7vesc may be confined to the central few kpc of the galaxy, owing to gas drag and steep central potentials. (2) vesc in gas-rich mergers may increase rapidly during final coalescence, in which case recoil trajectories may depend sensitively on the timing of the BH merger relative to the formation of the central potential well. Delays of even a few times 107 yr in the BH merger time may substantially suppress recoiling BH motion for a fixed kick speed. (3) Recoil events generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but short-period recoil oscillations may actually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4) Bondi-Hoyle accretion dominates recoiling BH growth for vk/vesc≲ 0.6-0.8; for higher vk, the BH accretes primarily from its ejected gas disc, which we model as a time-dependent accretion disc. (5) Kinematically offset AGNs may be observable either immediately after a high-velocity recoil or during pericentric passages through a gas-rich remnant. In either case, AGN lifetimes may be up to ∼10 Myr (for Δv {\textgreater} 800 km s-1), though the latter generally have higher luminosities. (6) Spatially offset AGNs can occur for vk≳ 0.5-0.7vesc (for ΔR {\textgreater} 1 kpc); these generally have low luminosities and lifetimes of ∼1-100 Myr. (7) Rapidly recoiling BHs may be up to approximately five times less massive than their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization of the MBH-σ* relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (8) Finally, the displacement of AGN feedback after a recoil event enhances central star formation rates in the merger remnant, thereby extending the starburst phase of the merger and creating a denser, more massive stellar cusp.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 (≈3σ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 × 10-5 to 1.9 × 10-4 (≈3.5σ-4σ). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$\{2.4\}\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

We analysed (i) the full 24.7-year EPTA data set, (ii) its 10.3-year subset based on modern observing systems, (iii) the combination of the full data set with the first data release of the InPTA for ten commonly timed millisecond pulsars, and (iv) the combination of the 10.3-year subset with the InPTA data. These combinations allowed us to probe the contributions of instrumental noise and interstellar propagation effects. With the full data set, we find marginal evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of four and a false alarm probability of \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$. With the 10.3-year subset, we report evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of \$60\$ and a false alarm probability of about \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance). The addition of the InPTA data yields results that are broadly consistent with the EPTA-only data sets, with the benefit of better noise modelling. Analyses were performed with different data processing pipelines to test the consistency of the results from independent software packages. The inferred spectrum from the latest EPTA data from new generation observing systems is rather uncertain and in mild tension with the common signal measured in the full data set. However, if the spectral index is fixed at 13/3, the two data sets give a similar amplitude of (\$2.5{\textbackslash}pm0.7){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a reference frequency of \$1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) is a collaboration aiming at the direct GW detection with observations carried out using Chinese radio telescopes. This short article serves as a “table of contents” for a forthcoming series of papers related to the CPTA Data Release 1 (CPTA DR1) which uses observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Here, after summarizing the time span and accuracy of CPTA DR1, we report the key results of our statistical inference finding a correlated signal with amplitude for spectral index in the range of α ∈ [ − 1.8, 1.5] assuming a GW background (GWB) induced quadrupolar correlation. The search for the Hellings–Downs (HD) correlation curve is also presented, where some evidence for the HD correlation has been found that a 4.6σ statistical significance is achieved using the discrete frequency method around the frequency of 14 nHz. We expect that the future International Pulsar Timing Array data analysis and the next CPTA data release will be more sensitive to the nHz GWB, which could verify the current results.},

The merger history of DM halos and MBHs is followed from z=20 to the present in a LCDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through halo mergers into larger and larger structures, sink to the center owing to dynamical friction against the DM background, accrete cold material in the merger remnant, and form MBH binary systems. Stellar dynamical interactions cause the hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence of the pair. The integrated emission from inspiraling MBH binaries results in a gravitational wave background (GWB).

We show that the corresponding self-regulation condition yields a correlation between black hole mass (Mbh) and galaxy velocity dispersion (σ) as inferred in the local universe and recovers the observed optical and X-ray luminosity functions of quasars at redshifts up to z{\textasciitilde}6 based on the hierarchical evolution of galaxy halos in a Λ-dominated cold dark matter cosmology. With only one free parameter and a simple algorithm, our model yields the observed evolution in the number density of optically bright or X-ray-faint quasars with 2{\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}6 across 3 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity and 3 orders of magnitude in comoving density per logarithm of luminosity. The self-regulation condition identifies the dynamical time of galactic disks during the epoch of peak quasar activity (z{\textasciitilde}2.5) as the origin of the inferred characteristic quasar lifetime of {\textasciitilde}107 yr. Since the lifetime becomes comparable to the Salpeter e-folding time at this epoch, the model also implies that the Mbh-σ relation is a product of feedback-regulated accretion during the peak of quasar activity. The mass density in black holes accreted by that time is consistent with the local black hole mass density ρbh{\textasciitilde}(2.3+4.0-1.5)×105 Msolar Mpc-3, which we have computed by combining the Mbh-σ relation with the measured velocity dispersion function of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. Comparison of the local black hole mass function with that inferred from combining the feedback relation with the halo mass function suggests that most massive ({\textgreater}109 Msolar) black holes may have already been in place by z{\textasciitilde}6. Applying a similar self-regulation principle to supernova-driven winds from starbursts, we find that the local ratio between the black hole mass and the stellar mass of galactic spheroids should be {\textasciitilde}0.001, independent of mass and in agreement with observations. This ratio increases with redshift, although the Mbh-σ relation is redshift-independent.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole binaries, with masses in the range 1E3-1E8 Msun, are expected to be the most powerful sources of gravitational radiation at mHz frequencies, and hence are among the primary targets for the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We extend and refine our previous analysis (Sesana et al. 2004), detailing the gravitational wave signal expected from a cosmological population of massive black hole binaries. As done in our previous paper, we follow the merger history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the massive black holes they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences in a LCDM cosmology. Stellar dynamical processes dominates the orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final coalescence of the pairs. We show that the GW signal from this population, in a 3 year LISA observation, will be resolved into approx 90 discrete events with S/N{\textgreater}5, among which approx. 35 will be observed above threshold until coalescence. These "merging events" involve relatively massive binaries, M=10E5 Msun, in the redshift range 2{\textless}z{\textless}6. The remaining approx. 55 events come from higher redshift, less massive binaries (M=5E3 Msun at z{\textgreater}6) and, although their S/N integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial, the final coalescence phase is at too high frequency to be directly observable by space-based interferometers such as LISA. LISA will be able to detect a fraction approx. 90\% of all the coalescences of massive black hole binaries occurring at z=5. The residual confusion noise from unresolved massive black hole binaries is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below the estimated stochastic noise.},

They are used to study the evolution of binaries in simple models for galactic nuclei, starting soon after the black holes become bound and continuing until the evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation, or until the ejected mass is too large for the galaxy to be considered fixed. The eccentricity growth is found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a large eccentricity. The scattering results are compared with predictions from Chandrasekhar's dynamical-friction formula and with previous work on the capture and scattering of comets by planetary systems.

	abstract = {The density of stars in galactic bulges is often observed to be flat or slowly rising inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Attributing the dynamical-friction force to stars moving more slowly than the test body, as is commonly done, is likely to be a poor approximation in such a core since there are no stars moving more slowly than the local circular velocity. We have tested this prediction using large-scale N-body experiments. The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because stars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force. When the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression for the dynamical-friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is found to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this rate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's formula in its most widely used forms, implying longer timescale for inspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core around the Galactic center (GC) SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral into the center of the Galaxy. After {\textasciitilde}10 Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially less than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be unjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the GC is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates of capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (extreme-mass-ratio inspirals) may be much lower than in standard models. When capture occurs, inspiraling BHs often reach the gravitational-radiation-dominated regime while on orbits that are still highly eccentric; even after the semimajor axis has decreased to values small enough for detection by space-based interferometers, eccentricities can be large enough that the efficient analysis of gravitational wave signals would require the use of eccentric templates. We finally study the orbital decay of satellite galaxies into the central region of giant ellipticals and discuss the formation of multi nuclei and multiplet of black holes in such systems.},

	abstract = {Simulations of binary black hole mergers indicate that asymmetrical gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at speeds up to thousands of km s-1. These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the co-evolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always assume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW recoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences of recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a multicomponent gaseous disc. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate on to the SMBH as a function of time, using a hybrid prescription of viscous (α-disc) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks between 100km s-1 and the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander through the galaxy and halo for {\textasciitilde}106-109yr before settling back to the galactic centre. However, the mass accreted during this time is roughly constant at {\textasciitilde}10per cent of the initial mass, independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large recoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil itself is an effective means of regulating SMBH growth. Recoiling SMBHs may be observable as spatially or kinematically offset quasars, but finding such systems could be challenging, because the largest offsets correspond to the shortest quasar lifetimes.},

Our configuration, which has a mass ratio of 2:1, consists of an initially non-spinning hole orbiting a larger, rapidly spinning hole (specific spin a/m = 0.885), with the spin direction oriented -45 degrees with respect to the orbital plane. We track the inspiral and merger for {\textasciitilde}2 orbits and find that the remnant receives a substantial kick of 454 km/s, more than twice as large as the maximum kick from non-spinning binaries. The remnant spin direction is flipped by 103 degrees with respect to the initial spin direction of the larger hole. We performed a second run with anti-aligned spins, a/m = +-0.5 lying in the orbital plane that produces a kick of 1830 km/s off the orbital plane. This value scales to nearly 4000 km/s for maximally spinning holes. Such a large recoil velocity opens the possibility that a merged binary can be ejected even from the nucleus of a massive host galaxy.},

We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in a timescale much shorter than the Hubble time before ejecting one BH through a slingshot. In order for a binary BH to merge before ejecting the third one, it has to become highly eccentric, since the GW timescale would be much longer than the Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that two mechanisms drive the increase of the eccentricity of the binary. One is the strong binary-single BH interaction, which results in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second is the Kozai mechanism, which drives the cyclic change of the inclination and eccentricity of the inner binary of a stable hierarchical triple system. Our result implies that many supermassive BHs are binaries.},

To study this behavior, we have included gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component. However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows toward the central regions where it may fuel the kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that radiative cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant, apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby changing the boundaries between the major orbital families.},

The tidal force of the outer black hole on the inner binary produces eccentricity oscillations through the Kozai mechanism, and this can substantially reduce the gravitational wave merger time of the inner binary. We numerically calculate the merger time for a wide range of initial conditions and black hole mass ratios, including the effects of octupole interactions in the triple as well as general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary. The semimajor axes and the mutual inclination of the inner and outer binaries are the most important factors affecting the merger time. We find that for a random distribution of inclination angles and approximately equal mass black holes, it is possible to reduce the merger time of a near circular inner binary by more than a factor of 10 in over 50\% of all cases. We estimate that a typical exterior quadrupole moment from surrounding matter in the galaxy may also be sufficient to excite eccentricity oscillations in supermassive black hole binaries and to accelerate black hole mergers.},

	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays aim to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). A background of GWs modulates pulsar arrival times and manifests as a stochastic process, common to all pulsars, with a signature spatial correlation. Here we describe a search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using observations of 30 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), which spans 18 yr. Using current Bayesian inference techniques we recover and characterize a common-spectrum noise process. Represented as a strain spectrum \$\{h\}\_\{c\}=A\{(f/1\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ , we measure \$A=\{3.1\}\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.3\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and α = -0.45 ± 0.20, respectively (median and 68\% credible interval). For a spectral index of α = -2/3, corresponding to an isotropic background of GWs radiated by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, we recover an amplitude of \$A=\{2.04\}\_\{-0.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ . However, we demonstrate that the apparent signal strength is time-dependent, as the first half of our data set can be used to place an upper limit on A that is in tension with the inferred common-spectrum amplitude using the complete data set. We search for spatial correlations in the observations by hierarchically analyzing individual pulsar pairs, which also allows for significance validation through randomizing pulsar positions on the sky. For a process with α = -2/3, we measure spatial correlations consistent with a GWB, with an estimated false-alarm probability of p ≲ 0.02 (approx. 2σ). The long timing baselines of the PPTA and the access to southern pulsars will continue to play an important role in the International Pulsar Timing Array.},

	abstract = {In the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can experience a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. Recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here the effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital configuration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one yielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead derived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form early, for example, as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases at later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution becoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts' potential wells. If seeds form at later times, in more massive halos, then the retention rate is much higher. We show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution of the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high-mass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real hazard for (1) MBHs in biased halos at high redshift, where mergers are more common and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very challenging to retain (2) MBHs merging in star clusters.},

    abstract = "{The abundance and structure of dark matter subhaloes have been analysed extensively in recent studies of dark-matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the subfind algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhaloes when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one per cent, of subhaloes within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. The fraction of mass contributed by gas in subhaloes is found to increase with the cluster-centric distance. Interestingly, this trend extends well beyond the virial radii, thus showing that galaxies feel the environment of the pressurized cluster gas over fairly large distances. The compact stellar cores (i.e. galaxies) are generally more resistant against tidal disruption than pure dark matter subhaloes. Still, the fraction of star-dominated substructures within our simulated clusters is only ∼10 per cent. We expect that the finite resolution in our simulations makes the galaxies overly susceptible to tidal disruption, hence the above fraction of star-dominated galaxies should represent a lower limit for the actual fraction of galaxies surviving the disruption of their host dark matter subhalo.}",

We illustrate the impact of the model parameter choices on the resulting simulated galaxy population properties at high and intermediate redshifts. We demonstrate that our scheme is capable of producing galaxy populations that broadly reproduce the shape of the observed galaxy stellar mass function extending from redshift z = 0 to z = 3. We also characterize the evolving galactic B-band luminosity function, stellar mass to halo mass ratio, star formation main sequence, Tully–Fisher relation and gas-phase mass–metallicity relation and confront them against recent observational estimates. This detailed comparison allows us to validate elements of our feedback model, while also identifying areas of tension (e.g., the shape and normalization of the mass–metallicity relation and normalization of the star formation main sequence) that will be addressed in future work.}",

The second problem is how to organize the algorithm to minimize memory and CPU overhead. This is an important consideration and will continue to be important as more sophisticated algorithms that use data structures other than arrays are developed for use on vector and parallel computers.}

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binary inspiral time scales are uncertain, and their spins are even more poorly constrained. Spin misalignment, along with unequal mass ratios and spin magnitudes, introduces asymmetry in the gravitational radiation, which imparts a recoil kick to the merged MBH. Understanding how MBH binary spins evolve is crucial for determining their recoil velocities, their gravitational wave (GW) waveforms detectable with LISA, as well as their post-merger retention rate in galaxies and thus their subsequent merger rate. Here we present a novel study that introduces a sub-resolution model for gas- and GW-driven MBH binary spin evolution using a population of accreting MBHs from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We also model sub-resolution binary inspiral via dynamical friction, stellar scattering, viscous gas drag, and GW emission. Our model assumes differential accretion, which causes greater alignment of the secondary MBH spin in unequal-mass mergers. We find that 47\% of the MBHs in our population merge by \$z=0\$. Of these, 19\% have misaligned primaries and 10\% have misaligned secondaries at the time of merger in our (conservative) fiducial model. The MBH misalignment fraction depends strongly on the accretion disc parameters, however. Reducing accretion rates by a factor of 100, in a thicker disc, yields 79\% and 42\% misalignment for primaries and secondaries, respectively. Even in the fiducial model, more than 12\% of binaries experience recoils of \${\textgreater}500\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which could displace them at least temporarily from galactic nuclei. We additionally find that a significant number of systems experience strong precession.},

Here, we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (1013 ≤ M200c/M⊙ ≤ 1015) at recent times (z ≤ 1). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 × 1014 M⊙ have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( − 3.5 ≲ α3D ≲ −3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as ∝(M500c)0.49 with a ∼0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( ≲ 1011 M⊙ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (∼0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with \$r^\{\\rm stars\}\_\{\\rm 0.5\} \\propto (M\_\{\\rm 200c\})^\{0.53\}\$. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.}",

TNG50 evolves 2 × 21603 dark matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of \$8.5\\times 10^4\\, \{\\rm M\}\_\{\\odot \}\$ and an average cell size of 70–140 pc in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples ∼700 (6500) galaxies with stellar masses above \$10^\{10\} \\, (10^8)\\, \{\\rm M\}\_\{\\odot \}\$ at \$z\$ = 1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 ≲ \$z\$ ≲ 6). We quantify their sizes, disc heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational versus dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by \$\\rm H\\,\\alpha\$ light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with ≲300-pc disc heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disc-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of \$10^\{9-11.5\}\\, \{\\rm M\}\_\{\\odot \}\$ star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported discs for most cosmic epochs (Vrot/σ \&gt; 2–3, \$z\$ ≲ 5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (\$z\$ ≳ 1.5). Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally dominated motions far exceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.}",

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binaries can form following a galaxy merger, but this may not always lead to a MBH binary merger within a Hubble time. The merger timescale depends on how efficiently the MBHs lose orbital energy to the gas and stellar background, and to gravitational waves (GWs). In systems where these mechanisms are inefficient, the binary inspiral time can be long enough for a subsequent galaxy merger to bring a third MBH into the system. In this work, we identify and characterize the population of triple MBH systems in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We find a substantial occurrence rate of triple MBH systems: in our fiducial model, 22\% of all binary systems form triples, and \${\textgreater}70\$\% of these involve binaries that would not otherwise merge by \$z=0\$. Furthermore, a significant subset of triples (6\% of all binaries, or more than a quarter of all triples) form a triple system at parsec scales, where the three BHs are most likely to undergo a strong three-body interaction. Crucially, we find that the rate of triple occurrence has only a weak dependence on key parameters of the binary inspiral model (binary eccentricity and stellar loss-cone refilling rate). We also do not observe strong trends in the host galaxy properties for binary versus triple MBH populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for triple systems to increase MBH merger rates, thereby enhancing the low-frequency GW signals detectable with pulsar timing arrays and with LISA.},

	abstract = {Inspiraling massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs) forming in the aftermath of galaxy mergers are expected to be the loudest gravitational-wave (GW) sources relevant for pulsar-timing arrays (PTAs) at nHz frequencies. The incoherent overlap of signals from a cosmic population of MBHBs gives rise to a stochastic GW background (GWB) with characteristic strain around \$h\_c{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a reference frequency of 1 yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, although uncertainties around this value are large. Current PTAs are piercing into the GW amplitude range predicted by MBHB-population models, but no detection has been reported so far. To assess the future success prospects of PTA experiments, it is therefore important to estimate the minimum GWB level consistent with our current understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies and massive black holes (MBHs). To this purpose, we couple a semianalytic model of galaxy evolution and an extensive study of the statistical outcome of triple MBH interactions. We show that even in the most pessimistic scenario where all MBHBs stall before entering the GW-dominated regime, triple interactions resulting from subsequent galaxy mergers inevitably drive a considerable fraction of the MBHB population to coalescence. At frequencies relevant for PTA, the resulting GWB is only a factor of 2-to-3 suppressed compared to a fiducial model where binaries are allowed to merge over Gyr timescales. Coupled with current estimates of the expected GWB amplitude range, our findings suggest that the minimum GWB from cosmic MBHBs is unlikely to be lower than \$h\_c{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-16\}\$ (at \$f = 1\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), well within the expected sensitivity of projected PTAs based on future observations with FAST, MeerKAT and SKA.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are expected to form at the centre of merging galaxies during the hierarchical assembly of the cosmic structure, and are expected to be the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low frequency domain. However, because of the dearth of energy exchanges with background stars and gas, many of these MBHBs may stall at separations too large for GW emission to drive them to coalescence in less than a Hubble time. Triple MBH systems are then bound to form after a further galaxy merger, triggering a complex and rich dynamics that can eventually lead to MBH coalescence. Here we report on the results of a large set of numerical simulations, where MBH triplets are set in spherical stellar potentials and MBH dynamics is followed through 2.5 post-Newtonian order in the equations of motion. From our full suite of simulated systems we find that a fraction \${\textbackslash}simeq 20-30\$\% of the MBH binaries that would otherwise stall are led to coalesce within a Hubble time. The corresponding coalescence timescale peaks around 300 Myr, while the eccentricity close to the plunge, albeit small, is non-negligible (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1\$). We construct and discuss marginalised probability distributions of the main parameters involved and, in a companion paper of the series, we will use the results presented here to forecast the contribution of MBH triplets to the GW signal in the nHz regime probed by Pulsar Timing Array experiments.},

However, many low-redshift MBHBs in realistic astrophysical environments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant GW emission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This "last-parsec problem" can be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole (MBH) -- the "intruder" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner MBHB on a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense GW emission eventually leading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven by the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the MBHB orbit, requires a general relativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the Newtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its hardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a three-body Post-Newtonian (PN) code framed in a realistic galactic potential, including both non-dissipative 1PN and 2PN terms, and dissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary, and the effect of the dynamical friction on the early stages of the intruder dynamics. In this first paper of a series devoted at studing the dynamics of MBH triplets from a cosmological perspective, we describe, test and validate our code.},

An assessment of LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this aim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within their host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the binaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with physically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between \${\textbackslash}approx 25\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx 75\$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall, triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation, resulting in about \${\textbackslash}approx 10\$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 20\$ LISA detections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can produce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.9\$) upon entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) found in the centres of many galaxies are understood to play a fundamental, active role in the cosmological structure formation process. In hierarchical formation scenarios, SMBHs are expected to form binaries following the merger of their host galaxies. If these binaries do not coalesce before the merger with a third galaxy, the formation of a black hole triple system is possible. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of triples within galaxy cores exhibit phases of very high eccentricity (as high as e∼ 0.99). During these phases, intense bursts of gravitational radiation can be emitted at orbital periapsis, which produces a gravitational wave signal at frequencies substantially higher than the orbital frequency. The likelihood of detection of these bursts with pulsar timing and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is estimated using several population models of SMBHs with masses \&gt;rsim 107 M⊙. Assuming that 10 per cent or more of binaries are in triple systems, we find that up to a few dozen of these bursts will produce residuals \&gt;1 ns, within the sensitivity range of forthcoming pulsar timing arrays. However, most of such bursts will be washed out in the underlying confusion noise produced by all the other ‘standard’ SMBH binaries emitting in the same frequency window. A detailed data analysis study would be required to assess resolvability of such sources. Implementing a basic resolvability criterion, we find that the chance of catching a resolvable burst at a 1 ns precision level is 2–50 per cent, depending on the adopted SMBH evolution model. On the other hand, the probability of detecting bursts produced by massive binaries (masses ≳107 M⊙) with LISA is negligible.},

The relative weight between the different terms is fixed by amplitude parameters chosen through a least-squares fit of recently available fully nonlinear numerical simulations. These formulae can be used for statistical studies of N-body simulations of galaxy cores and clusters, and the cosmological growth of supermassive black holes.

In nine systems, the X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) is spatially offset from the galactic stellar core that is located within the 3″ diameter SDSS spectroscopic fiber. In 11 systems, the X-ray AGN is spatially offset from a stellar core that is located outside the fiber, with an overlap of two. To build the sample, we cross-matched Type II AGNs selected from the SDSS galaxy catalog with archival Chandra imaging and employed our custom astrometric and registration procedure. The projected angular (physical) offsets span a range of 0.″6 (0.8 kpc) to 17.″4 (19.4 kpc), with a median value of 2.″7 (4.6 kpc). The offset nature of an AGN is an unambiguous signature of a galaxy merger, and these systems can be used to study the properties of AGNs in galaxy mergers without the biases introduced by morphological merger selection techniques. In this paper (Paper I), we use our sample to assess the kinematics of AGN photoionized gas in galaxy mergers. We find that spectroscopic offset AGN selection may be up to \% incomplete due to small projected velocity offsets. We also find that the magnitude of the velocity offsets are generally larger than expected if our spatial selection introduces a bias toward face-on orbits, suggesting the presence of complex kinematics in the emission line gas of AGNs in galaxy mergers.},

	abstract = {In the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can experience a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. Recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here the effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital configuration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one yielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead derived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form early, for example, as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases at later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution becoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts' potential wells. If seeds form at later times, in more massive halos, then the retention rate is much higher. We show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution of the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high-mass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real hazard for (1) MBHs in biased halos at high redshift, where mergers are more common and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very challenging to retain (2) MBHs merging in star clusters.},

	abstract = {Coalescence of binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) would constitute the strongest sources of gravitational waves to be observed by LISA. While the formation of binary SBHs during galaxy mergers is almost inevitable, coalescence requires that the separation between binary components first drop by a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to interaction of the binary with stars and gas in a galactic nucleus. This article reviews the observational evidence for binary SBHs and discusses how they would evolve. No completely convincing case of a bound, binary SBH has yet been found, although a handful of systems (e.g. interacting galaxies; remnants of galaxy mergers) are now believed to contain two SBHs at projected separations of roughly one kpc. N-body studies of binary evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached large enough particle numbers to reproduce the slow, "diffusive" refilling of the binary's loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in real galactic nuclei. While some of the results of these simulations -- e.g. the binary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution -- are strongly \$N\$-dependent, others -- e.g. the "damage" inflicted by the binary on the nucleus -- are not. Luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted cores with masses of 1-2 times the mass of their nuclear SBHs, consistent with the predictions of the binary model. Studies of the interaction of massive binaries with gas are still in their infancy, although much progress is expected in the near future. Binary coalescence has a large influence on the spins of SBHs, even for mass ratios as extreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been observed.},

Unlike most other currently available cosmological simulations, black holes are seeded based on local gas properties and are permitted to evolve dynamically without being fixed at halo centres. Tracking these black holes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find that the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo mass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster halos. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local black hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for. Yet for higher redshifts (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$), wandering black holes both outweigh and outshine their central supermassive counterparts. Most wandering black holes, we find, remain close to the seed mass and originate from the centres of previously disrupted satellite galaxies. While most do not retain a resolved stellar counterpart, those that do are situated farther out at larger fractions of the virial radius. Wanderers with higher luminosities are preferentially at lower radius, more massive, and either closer to their host's mid-planes or associated with a stellar overdensity. This analysis shows that our current census of supermassive black holes is incomplete and that a substantial population of off-centre wanderers likely exists.},

We sample four different spin distributions (random, aligned, anti-aligned, and zero spin), and compare the resulting merger rates, occupation fractions, and MBH-host relations with what is expected by excluding the effect of recoil. The inclusion of gravitational recoil and MBH spin in the assembly of MBH seeds can reduce the final \$z=5\$ MBH mass by up to an order of magnitude. The MBH occupation fraction, however, remains effectively unaltered due to episodes of black hole formation following a recoil event.

We construct various merger remnant galaxies in order to investigate how the central SMBH mass and the mass ratio of progenitor galaxies influence escape velocities of recoiling SMBHs. Our results show that static analytical models of major merger remnant galaxies overestimate the SMBHs escape velocities. During major mergers violent relaxation leads to the decrease of galaxy mass and lower potential at large remnant radii. This process is not depicted in static analytical potential but clearly seen in our numerical models. Thus, the evolving numerical model is a more realistic description of dynamical processes in galaxies with merging SMBHs. We find that SMBH escape velocities in numerical major merger remnant galaxies can be up to 25 per cent lower compared to those in analytical models. Consequently, SMBHs in numerical models generally reach greater galactocentric distances and spend more time on bound orbits outside of the galactic nuclei. Thus, numerical models predict a greater number of spatially-offset active galactic nuclei (AGNs).},

	abstract = {We use numerical relativity to study the merger and ringdown stages of "superkick" binary black hole systems (those with equal mass and anti-parallel spins). We find a universal way to describe the mass and current quadrupole gravitational waves emitted by these systems during the merger and ringdown stage: (i) The time evolutions of these waves are insensitive to the progenitor's parameters (spins) after being normalized by their own peak values. (ii) The peak values, which encode all the spin information of the progenitor, can be consistently fitted to formulas inspired by post-Newtonian theory. We find that the universal evolution of the mass quadrupole wave can be accurately modeled by the so-called Backwards One-Body (BOB) model. However, the BOB model, in its present form, leads to a lower waveform match and a significant parameter-estimation bias for the current quadrupole wave. We also decompose the ringdown signal into seven overtones, and study the dependence of mode amplitudes on the progenitor's parameters. Such dependence is found to be insensitive to the overtone index (up to a scaling factor). Finally, we use the Fisher matrix technique to investigate how the ringdown waveform can be at least as important for parameter estimation as the inspiral stage. Assuming the Cosmic Explorer, we find the contribution of ringdown portion dominates as the total mass exceeds {\textasciitilde} 250 solar mass. For massive BBH systems, the accuracy of parameter measurement is improved by incorporating the information of ringdown -- the ringdown sector gives rise to a different parameter correlation from inspiral stage, hence the overall parameter correlation is reduced in the full signal.},

In this work we study this "sinking problem" with state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological simulations, combined with both direct \$N\$-body integration of seed BH trajectories and post-processing of randomly generated test particles with a newly developed dynamical friction estimator.

We also discuss two possible solutions: dramatically increasing the number of seeds such that one seed can end up trapped in the galactic center by chance, or seed BHs being embedded in dense structures (e.g. star clusters) with effective masses above the mass threshold. We discuss the limitations of both solutions.},

	abstract = {We investigate the consequences of a model of the assembly and growth of massive black holes from primordial seeds, remnants of the first generation of stars in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. Our model traces the build-up of MBHs from an early epoch, and follows the merger history of dark matter halos and their associated holes via Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present time. The sequence of minor and major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growth affects the merger history of MBHs embedded in their nuclei. So, if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs dates back to the early universe, a large number of BH interactions is inevitable. Binary black holes coalescence timescales can be long enough for a third BH to fall in and interact with the central binary. These BH triple interactions lead typically to the final expulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. Also, asymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black hole merging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescing binary. This scenario leads to the prediction of a population of intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs) wandering in galaxy halos at the present epoch. We compute the luminosity distribution produced by these IMBHs accreting from their circumstellar medium. We find that in a Milky Way-sized galaxy they are unable to account for sources with luminosities {\textgreater} 1e39 erg/s unless they carry a baryonic remnant from which they are able to accrete for a long time. We also find that, for typical spiral galaxies, the bright end of the point source distribution correlates with the mass of the galaxy, and the most luminous sources are expected to be found in the disk.},

	abstract = {Massive black holes (MBHs) inhabit galaxy centers, power luminous quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and shape their cosmic environment with the energy they produce. The origins of MBHs remain a mystery and the recent detection by LIGO/Virgo of an almost 150 solar mass black hole has revitalized the question of whether there is a continuum between “stellar” and “massive” black holes and what the seeds of MBHs are. Seeds could have formed in the ﬁrst galaxies, or could be also related to the collapse of horizon-sized regions in the early Universe. Understanding the origins of MBHs straddles fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics and it bridges the ﬁelds of gravitational wave physics and traditional astronomy. With several facilities in the next 10-15 years we foresee the possibility of discovering MBHs’ avenues of formation. In this article we link three main topics: the channels of black hole seed formation, the journey from seeds to massive black holes, the diagnostics on the origins of MBHs. We highlight and critically discuss current unsolved problems and touch on recent developments that stirred the community.},

The Ketju simulation code, a combination of the Gadget tree solver with accurate regularised integration, uses unsoftened forces between the star/dark matter components and the MBHs for an accurate treatment of dynamical friction and scattering of dark matter/stars by MBH binaries or multiples. Post-Newtonian corrections up to order 3.5 for MBH interactions allow for coalescence by gravitational wave emission and gravitational recoil kicks. Low mass MBHs (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) hardly sink to the centre or merge. Sinking MBHs have various complex evolution paths - binaries, triplets, free-floating MBHs, and dynamically or recoil ejected MBHs. Collisional interactions with dark matter alone can drive MBHs to coalescence. The highest mass MBHs of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ mostly sink to the centre and trigger the scouring of dark matter and stellar cores. The scouring can transform a centrally baryon dominated system to a dark matter dominated system. Our idealized high-resolution study highlights the difficulty to bring in and keep low mass MBHs in the centres of low mass halos/galaxies - a remaining challenge for merger assisted MBH seed growth mechanisms.},

However, as BCGs experienced numerous galaxy mergers throughout their history, the central BH can be significantly kicked from the central region by these dynamical encounters. By combining the Illustris-TNG300 simulations and orbital integrations, we demonstrate that mergers with satellite galaxies on radial orbits are a main driver for such BH displacements in BCGs. BHs can get ejected to distances varying between a few parsecs to hundreds of kiloparsecs. Our results clearly establish that SMBH offsets are common in BCGs and more precisely a third of our BHs are off-centred at \$z=0\$. This orbital offset can be sustained for up to at least 6 Gyr between \$z=2\$ and \$z=0\$ in half of our BCGs. Since the dense gas reservoirs are located in the central region of galaxies, we argue that the consequences of off-center SMBHs in BCGs are to quench any BH growth and BH feedback.},

	abstract = {Galaxies with stellar bulges are generically observed to host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The hierarchical merging of galaxies should therefore lead to the formation of SMBH binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little gas promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where SMBH binaries are expected to survive over long times. If the binary lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers, then triple black hole (BH) systems may form. We study the statistics of close triple-SMBH encounters in galactic nuclei by computing a series of 3-body orbits with physically-motivated initial conditions appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our simulations include a smooth background potential consisting of a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo, drag forces due to gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars and dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the inner density profile under heating and mass ejection by the SMBHs. We find that the binary pair coalesces as a result of repeated close encounters in {\textasciitilde}85\% of our runs, and in {\textasciitilde}15\% of cases a new eccentric binary forms from the third SMBH and binary remnant and coalesces during the run time. In about 40\% of the runs the lightest BH is left wandering through the galactic halo or escapes the galaxy altogether, but escape of all three SMBHs is exceedingly rare. The triple systems typically scour out cores with mass deficits {\textasciitilde}1-2 times their total mass, which can help to account for the large cores observed in some massive elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence rate, prevalence of very high-eccentricity orbits, and gravitational radiation ``spikes'' during close encounters in our runs, may provide interesting signals for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).},

	abstract = {Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) could be the loudest gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the millihertz (mHz) GW band, but their dynamical evolution may stall when the black holes reach the innermost parsec of a galaxy. Such a "final-parsec problem" could be solved if an MBHB forms in a gas-rich environment, such as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), but other solutions not involving AGNs also exist. Testing the correlation between these mHz GW sources and AGNs is difficult in real observation because AGNs are ubiquitous. To overcome this difficulty, we use a statistical method, first designed to constrain the host galaxies of stellar-mass binary black holes, to search for the MBHB-AGN correlation in different astrophysical scenarios. We find that by detecting only one MBHB at z ≲ 0.5, a mHz GW detector, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, can already distinguish different merger scenarios thanks to the precise localization of the source. Future detector networks and deeper AGNs surveys can further testify to the MBHB-AGN correlation up to a redshift of z {\textasciitilde} 2 even if only a small fraction of MBHBs merge inside AGNs. These constraints will help settle the long-standing debate on the possible solutions to the final-parsec problem.},

	abstract = {Simulations of binary black hole mergers indicate that asymmetrical gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at speeds up to thousands of km/s. These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the coevolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always assume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW recoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences of recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a multi-component gaseous disk. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate onto the SMBH as a function of time using a hybrid prescription of viscous (alpha-disk) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks between 100 km/s and the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander through the galaxy and halo for about 1 Myr - 1 Gyr before settling back to the galactic center. However, the mass accreted during this time is roughly constant at about 10\% of the initial mass, independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large recoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil itself is an effective means of regulating SMBH growth. Recoiling SMBHs may be observable as spatially or kinematically offset quasars, but finding such systems could be challenging, because the largest offsets correspond to the shortest quasar lifetimes.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) coalescences are powerful sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. To study these events in the cosmological context we need to trace the large-scale structure and cosmic evolution of a statistical population of galaxies, from dim dwarfs to bright galaxies. To cover such a large range of galaxy masses, we analyse two complementary simulations: Horizon-AGN with a large volume and low resolution which tracks the high-mass ({\textgreater} 107 M ) MBH population, and NewHorizon with a smaller volume but higher resolution that traces the low-mass ({\textless} 107 M ) MBH population. While Horizon-AGN can be used to estimate the rate of inspirals for Pulsar Timing Arrays, NewHorizon can investigate MBH mergers in a statistical sample of dwarf galaxies for LISA, which is sensitive to low-mass MBHs. We use the same method to analyse the two simulations, post-processing MBH dynamics to account for time delays mostly determined by dynamical friction and stellar hardening. In both simulations, MBHs typically merge long after galaxies do, so that the galaxy morphology at the time of the MBH merger is no longer determined by the structural disturbances engendered by the galaxy merger from which the MBH coalescence has originated. These time delays cause a loss of high-z MBH coalescences, shifting the peak of the MBH merger rate to z ∼ 1 − 2. This study shows how tracking MBH mergers in lowmass galaxies is crucial to probing the MBH merger rate for LISA and investigate the properties of the host galaxies.},

For this purpose, we construct initial conditions from the ROMULUS25 data and perform high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We track the orbital evolution from the galactic inspiral to the formation of hard binaries at sub-parsec separation and use the observed hardening rates to project the time of coalescence. In all cases, the two heaviest black holes form an efficiently hardening binary that merges within fractions of the Hubble time. The lightest SMBH either gets ejected, forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, forms a hardening binary with the previously merged binary’s remnant, or remains on a wide galactic orbit. The coalescence times of the lighter black holes are thus significantly longer than for the heavier binary, as they experience lower dynamical friction and stellar hardening rates. We observe the formation of hierarchical triples when the density profile of the galactic nucleus is sufficiently steep.},

For the dynamical modelling of this triple SBMH system, we used the massively parallel and GPU accelerated phi-GPU direct summation N-body code. Following a long-timescale modelling of the triple system, we carried out a very detailed time output analysis of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations for the black holes. According to our Newtonian simulation results, for all models and randomisations, the bound system from S1+S2 components formed at {\textasciitilde}3.6 Myr. The formation of the bound hierarchical triple system S+N occurred at {\textasciitilde}18 Myr. Over the course of these Newtonian simulations of the evolution of the triple SMBH system and the surrounding environment in NGC 6240, ZLK oscillations were detected (in most cases) for the binary components. The inclination angle between the orbital angular momentum of binary components aptly coincides with the theoretical calculations of the ZLK mechanism. In our set of randomised 15 Newtonian \$N\$-body dynamical galaxy models in 13 systems, we were able to detect a ZLK mechanism. In contrast, our extra few-body post-Newtonian runs (for one randomisation case) show it is only for the large inner binary initial eccentricity (in our case {\textgreater}0.9 that we are able to observe the possibility of the inner binary merging, due to the post-Newtonian energy radiation effects. For the lower eccentricity cases, the test runs show no sign of possible merging or any ZLK oscillations in the system.},

Astrid includes galaxy formation and black hole models recently updated with an MBH seed population between 3 × 104h-1M⊙ and 3 × 105h-1M⊙ and a sub-grid dynamical friction (DF) model to follow the MBH dynamics down to 1.5 ckpc h-1. We calculate the initial eccentricities of MBH orbits directly from the simulation at kpc-scales, and find orbital eccentricities above 0.7 for most MBH pairs before the numerical merger. After approximating unresolved evolution on scales below \$\{{\textbackslash}sim 200{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{pc\}\}\$, we find that the in-simulation DF on large scales accounts for more than half of the total orbital decay time (\${\textbackslash}sim 500{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{Myr\}\$) due to DF. The binary hardening time is an order of magnitude longer than the DF time, especially for the seed-mass binaries (MBH {\textless} 2Mseed). As a result, only \${\textbackslash}lesssim 20\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per {\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ of seed MBH pairs merge at z {\textgreater} 3 after considering both unresolved DF evolution and binary hardening. These z {\textgreater} 3 seed-mass mergers are hosted in a biased population of galaxies with the highest stellar masses of \$ 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. With the higher initial eccentricity prediction from Astrid , we estimate an expected merger rate of 0.3-0.7 per year from the z {\textgreater} 3 MBH population. This is a factor of {\textasciitilde}7 higher than the prediction using the circular orbit assumption. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna events are expected at a similar rate, and comprise \$rsim 60{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm\{per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ seed-seed mergers, \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm\{per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ involving only one seed-mass MBH, and \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm\{per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ mergers of non-seed MBHs.},

	abstract = {Central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are a ubiquitous feature of locally-observed galaxies, and ample evidence suggests that the growth of SMBHs and their host galaxies is closely linked. However, in the event of a merger, gravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or eject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use hydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH recoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the behavior of recoiling BHs — specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their observable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i) Recoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy; maximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of magnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil trajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the formation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v {\textgreater} 800 km s-1) or spatial offsets (R {\textgreater} 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In addition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally reduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN lifetimes. (iii) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive than their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization of the M - σ relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter. Furthermore, recoil events displace AGN feedback from the galactic center, which enhances central star formation rates. This results in longer starburst phases and higher central stellar densities in merger remnants.},

	abstract = {We characterize the population of wandering black holes, defined as those physically offset from their halo centres, in the ROMULUS cosmological simulations. Unlike most other currently available cosmological simulations, black holes are seeded based on local gas properties and are permitted to evolve dynamically without being fixed at halo centres. Tracking these black holes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find that the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo mass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster haloes. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local black hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for. Yet for higher redshifts (\$z\$ ≳ 4), wandering black holes both outweigh and outshine their central supermassive counterparts. Most wandering black holes, we find, remain close to the seed mass and originate from the centres of previously disrupted satellite galaxies. While most do not retain a resolved stellar counterpart, those that do are situated farther out at larger fractions of the virial radius. Wanderers with higher luminosities are preferentially at lower radius, more massive, and either closer to their host's mid-planes or associated with a stellar overdensity. This analysis shows that our current census of supermassive black holes is incomplete and that a substantial population of off-centre wanderers likely exists.},

	abstract = {While most galaxies appear to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), they are expected to also contain a substantial population of off-center "wandering" SMBHs naturally produced by the hierarchical merger-driven process of galaxy assembly. This population has been recently characterized in an analysis of the ROMULUS cosmological simulations, which correct for the dynamical forces on SMBHs without artificially pinning them to halo centers. Here we predict an array of electromagnetic signatures for these wanderers. The predicted wandering population of SMBHs from ROMULUS broadly reproduces the observed spatial offsets of a recent sample of hyperluminous X-ray sources. We predict that the sources with the most extreme offsets are likely to arise from SMBHs within satellite galaxies. These simulations also predict a significant population of secondary active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with luminosities at least 10\% that of the central AGN. The majority of galaxies at z = 4 that host a central AGN with bolometric luminosity Lbol {\textgreater} 1042 erg s-1 are predicted to host a companion off-center AGN of comparable brightness. We demonstrate that stacked X-ray observations of similar mass galaxies may reveal a halo of collective emission attributable to these wanderers. Finally, because wanderers dominate the population of SMBHs with masses of ≲107 M⊙ in ROMULUS, they may dominate tidal disruption event (TDE) rates at these masses if they retain a stellar component (e.g., a nuclear star cluster). This could warrant an order of magnitude correction to current theoretically estimated TDE rates at low SMBH masses.},

We track spin changes that BHs experience during both coalescence events and gas accretion phases. For the latter, we assume that spin changes are coupled with the bulge assembly. This assumption leads to predictions for the median spin values of z=0 BHs that depend on whether they are hosted by pseudobulges, classical bulges or ellipticals, being a {\textasciitilde} 0.9, 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. The outcomes of the model display a good consistency with z{\textless}4 quasar luminosity functions and the z=0 BH mass function, spin values and black hole-bulge mass correlation. Regarding the wBHs, we assume that they can originate from both the disruption of satellite galaxies (orphan wBH) and ejections due to gravitational recoils (ejected wBH). The model points to a number density of wBHs that increases with decreasing redshift, although this population is always {\textasciitilde}2 dex smaller than the one of nuclear black holes. At all redshifts, wBHs are typically hosted in M\_\{halo\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} and M\_\{stellar\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}, being orphan wBHs the dominant type. Besides, independently of redshift and halo mass, {\textbackslash}textit\{ejected\} wBHs inhabit the central regions ({\textless}0.3R\_\{200\}) of the host DM halo, while orphan wBHs linger at larger scales ({\textgreater}0.5R\_\{200\}). Finally, we find that gravitational recoils cause a progressive depletion of nuclear BHs with decreasing redshift and stellar mass. Moreover, ejection events lead to changes in the predicted local black hole-bulge relation, in particular for BHs in pseudobulges, for which the relation is flattened at M\_\{bulge\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10.2\} M\{{\textbackslash}odot\} and the scatter increase up to {\textasciitilde}3dex.},
